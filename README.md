Working to create a complete C# / Blazor diagraming experience for developers.

The Blazor demo built for NDC Oslo 2023 is now available as a NuGet package. The library includes .NET 8 and Blazor features. There are new 2D shapes, layout algorithms with glued connections, scaled multi-page diagrams and better 2D/3D integration. The features of Visio, Three.js and CesiumJS are now available in Blazor, both client and server.
